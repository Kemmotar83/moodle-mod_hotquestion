=== 3.8.0 ===
11/21/19 Made changes in locallib.php to fix linelength error in two functions 
Changed line 317 of function get_questions() - tested - still works.
Changed line 395 of function remove_round() - tested - still works.
11/21/19 In file upgrade.txt, I changed all the "\r\n" to just "\n" using replace all,
without any apparent problems. I also made a bunch of line length changes due to
codechecker recommendations. Made multiple entries to make sure I did not break something.
11/22/19 Added settings for Teacher Priority visibility and for Heat visibility. This
required some new language strings, two new fields in the mdl_hotquestion table,
and multiple lines of new code in renderer.php. It also required changes in the
install.xml file, the upgrade.php file, and the backup_hotquestion_stepslib.php file.
The final change was to bump the version to 3.8.0 and push to github.
